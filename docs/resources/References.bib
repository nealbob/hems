@techreport{Sheng2011,
abstract = {Productivity growth has been a key factor driving agricultural output in Australia. More than two-thirds of the current real value of Australian agricultural output can be attributed to productivity growth that has occurred since the early 1950s (Mullen and Crean 2007; Sheng et al. 2010). One important source of productivity growth is new technology from investment in research. However, observers are increasingly concerned that agricultural productivity growth in Australia, as in some other developed countries, has been slowing. The objective of this study was to test whether any slowdown in Australian broadacre productivity growth has occurred and, if so, to determine when it occurred and the likely causes. A well-known statistical method based on an analysis of recursive residuals from regression models (the CUSQ method) was used to examine the systematic deviation from trend in current total factor productivity in Australian broadacre agriculture between 1952–53 and 2006–07. As a measure of productivity in Australian broadacre agriculture, total factor productivity is highly variable due, in part, to unstable seasonal effects. Therefore, detecting fundamental shifts in the long-term trend requires suitable statistical methods. The report concludes that a significant structural change, or turning point, occurred in the total factor productivity series in the mid-1990s. Further, it suggests that the slowdown was likely due to a combination of adverse seasonal conditions and stagnant public research and development expenditure since the late 1970s. This study lends support to the argument that public investment in agricultural research and development has been critical in driving agricultural productivity growth in the past and highlights the important role it could play in countering the expected adverse effects on broadacre farm productivity of changing climate, increasing water scarcity and other resource constraints, and to meet the demand for food from a growing world population.},
